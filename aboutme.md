My name is Fabian Riquelme. As an engineer, researcher, and innovator, I possess a profound interest in taking on complex projects. Specifically, my expertise lies in design-build project management, where my civil engineering background and research abilities equip me with an understanding of the intricacies of design and its impact on the construction industry. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and striving towards career growth. As a step in that direction, I'm pursuing a Master of Data Science at Berkeley, focusing on AI and machine learning. My ultimate aim is to develop tools that can aid the engineering and construction industry.



### My story

Once upon a time, there was a civil engineer named Fabian who lived in Chile. Fabian was an expert in managing construction projects and had been doing so for several years. However, he wanted to take his career to the next level and work with the best technology in the world.

Fabian became interested in the cutting-edge technology being developed in Silicon Valley, and he dreamed of applying it to the construction industry. So, he decided to pack his bags, say goodbye to his friends and family, and move to California to start his new journey.

In Silicon Valley, Fabian immersed himself in the latest technological advancements and their potential applications in construction project management. He sought out opportunities to work on projects that would allow him to leverage his expertise in both civil engineering and cutting-edge technology.

With his passion for innovation and his dedication to his work, Fabian quickly made a name for himself in the industry. He was highly sought after by top engineering firms, and he was able to work on some of the most challenging and complex construction projects in the world.

However, Fabian knew that he could do more. He became interested in data science and the ways in which it could be used to solve complex problems in the engineering and construction industry. This newfound interest sparked a desire to pursue a Master of Data Science degree at one of the best universities in the world: UC Berkeley.

At Berkeley, Fabian honed his skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. He was fascinated by the endless possibilities that data science offered and how it could be applied to the construction industry to solve complex problems.

After completing his degree, Fabian returned to Silicon Valley, eager to apply his newfound knowledge to his work managing construction projects. He sought out projects that would allow him to leverage his expertise in both civil engineering and data science, and he quickly became a leader in the industry.

In the end, Fabian realized that moving from Chile to Silicon Valley to manage projects with the best technology in the world was the best decision he ever made. Despite the challenges, he persevered and found a way to use his skills to make a real difference in the world of construction and engineering.
